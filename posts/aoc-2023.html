      <h3><u>Part 1</u></h3>
      <p>Each line consists of characters with some of those characters being integers, we can use some regex (<code>"\d"</code>) to extract single digits from the string then concatenate the first and last digits found and accumulate. Since we're working with all single digits concatenation can be done by multiplying the first digit by 10 then adding the second, which will be faster than converting to strings and back.</p>

      <h3><u>Part 2</u></h3>
      <p>Part 2 requires parsing not only the individual characters but sub strings in order to find digits, this can be done in a hacky way by using Python's <code>replace()</code> function. Here we can replace each occurrence of "one", "two", "three", etc with its respective digit then do the same as part 1.</p>
      <p>However consider the edge cases: </p>

  <pre><code class="plaintext">
  twone
  oneeight
  sevenine
  </code></pre>

      <p>when replacing the sub string with a digit we corrupt the other sub string (e.g. <code>"2ne"</code> therefore to make our solution even more hacky we can keep the first and last character of the sub string inserting the digit in between.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
# convert the digit strings into single digit values
def convert(line):
  for i, digit in enumerate(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']):
    line = line.replace(digit, digit[0] + str(i+1) + digit[-1])

  return line
      </code></pre>

      <h3><u>Part 1</u></h3>
      <p>This problem is mostly input parsing, separating each line into a game ID and each game allows us to iterate over each game checking if any of the cubes for any of the games exceed the given threshold, if they don't we accumulate the game ID.</p>
      <p>This was performed using some Python string parsing (<code>.split()</code>) and some regex to extract the relevant values</p>
      <h3><u>Part 2</u></h3>
      <p>Part 2 was much the same but instead keeping track of the number of cubes used throughout multiple turns of a single game, we then get the maximum number for each colour and multiply then accumulate to get the answer.</p>

      <h3><u>Part 1</u></h3>
      <p>
      Today's problem was a grid problem, i used my custom grid class in my helper file which lets me iterate over all the points, get neighbours, handle valid points, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
      First we need to find all the symbols by iterating over each point in the the grid and get any points that are not <code>.</code> or a digit. For each symbol we can check if any of the neighbours of that symbol are digits (which will be a single digit from a valid part number) and record the coords of that digit.
      </p>
  <pre><code class="plaintext">
  ...*......
  ..35..633.
  ......#...

  6 and 3 are digits next to '#'

  3 and 5 are valid digits next to '*'
  </code></pre>

      <p>
      Now we have a bunch of coords of digits that belong to valid part numbers we need to get the full part number, this can be done by starting at the found digit and moving backwards and forwards through the row until we hit a non digit symbol. 
  <pre><code class="plaintext">
  .664.598.. # move left until we hit a non digit
        ^
  .664.598..  
       ^
  .664.598..  # found start of digit
      ^

  .664.598..  # move right until we hit a non digit
        ^
  .664.598..
         ^
  .664.598..  # found end of digit
          ^
  </code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      The last step is to remove any duplicates since a part number may be adjacent to multiple symbols or we may find multiple digits from the same part number next to a symbol. We can then accumulate the results.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Part 2</u></h3>
      <p>
        Part 2 was relatively straight forward given the above solution. Now we only find neighbouring digits next to the symbol <code>*</code>. Once we extract the full part number and de-duplicate we can check if 2 part numbers are next to the symbol and multiply them together.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3><u>Part 1</u></h3>
      <p>
        This problem just requires us to iterate over each scratchcard, find the number of matching numbers, and calculate the score. The score doubles for every matching number we have so this can be calculated with the following:
      </p>

      $$ score = 2^{m-1} \quad \text{where } m > 0 $$

      <p>
        Where <strong>m</strong> is the number of matching numbers.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Part 2</u></h3>
      <p>
        Part 2 was solved using memoisation where for each card number the number of additional cards gained was recursively calculated and saved. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, for each card we find the number of matches <strong>m</strong> then get the next <strong>m</strong> cards (these are our additional winning cards). For each new card gained find the number of cards that scratchcard will gain, this will either already be known from previous calculation or need to be recursively calculated. An overview of the pseudocode can be seen below:
      </p>
<pre><code class="plaintext">
1. for each scratchcard
2.   m <- number of matches
3.   for each new_card given by m
4.     if num_cards(new_card) already known 
5.       accumulate to answer
6.     else
7.       calculate num_cards(new_card) and add answer to known

</code></pre>
    <p>
      Where num_cards() is steps 2 through 7
    </p>

      <h3><u>Part 1</u></h3>
      <p>
        Part 1 is relatively straight forward once the rules of mapping numbers are understood, take the following rule
      </p>
        <pre><code class="plaintext">
50 98 5
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        Here the range in which we can map values is <code>98 - 102</code>, 102 is computed with <code>98 + 5 - 1</code>. This can be visualised with the following:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="plaintext">
98 -> 50
99 -> 51
100 -> 52
101 -> 53
102 -> 54
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        So any value in the range <code>98 - 102</code> will be converted to the respective destination value. The simplest method to quickly convert from the source to the destination is by subtracting the input value by the difference between the source and destination <code>98 - 50 = 48</code>. Hence the value <code>102</code> can be converted with the following:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="plaintext">
102 - 48 = 54        
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Applying this method we can parse the mapping rules for each map type, and iteratively convert each input value (initially the seeds) to the new value. This is done by checking if the input value is within the source range and applying our quick conversion trick, if the value is not in any of the source ranges then we don't change it.
      </p>

      <h3><u>Part 2</u></h3>
      Part 2 is where things get tricky. Here the mapping rules are the same but the input is interpreted as the following:
      <pre><code class="plaintext">
79 14 55 13
     v
(79 14) & (55 13)
     v
[79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92] &
[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The final two lists are now our inputs, this is manageable for the test data and the same method for part 2 can be applied, but there are just too many values in the input data to map them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to optimise our solution we need to consider the input not as individual values but as ranges. As we can see above the two lists are just ranges, one between <code>79 - 92</code> and another between <code>55 - 67</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the mapping is also done in ranges (the values <code>98 - 102</code> map to <code>50 - 54</code>) we can just keep track of the ranges of our values instead of individual integers. Consider this example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="plaintext">
input: 99 3
input range: 99 - 101

does the input range fall into the first map? (98 - 102)

...Yes!

then map the input range to the new input range:
    (99 - 101) -> (51 - 53)
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      We can see from the example above that instead of mapping each individual value between <strong>99</strong> and <strong>101</strong> we instead mapped the lower and upper bound of the range. Since the problem is asking for the smallest resulting value we will be able to find it in one of the lower bounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing to consider here is what if the input range doesn't perfectly fit within a map's range? Here we will need to split the input range, mapping the range that falls within the map's boundaries and creating a new range. Again consider the example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="plaintext">
input: 99 8
input range: 99 - 106

does the input range fall into the first map? (98 - 102)

...Partially!

then split the range into sections that do and don't fall into the map
  (99 - 106) -> (99 - 102) & (103 - 106)

now map the section that falls into the range of the map
  (99 - 102) -> (51 - 54)

now we are left with two ranges:
  (51 - 54), (103 - 106)
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Doing this for each map, splitting the input ranges where required and mapping the ranges to new values when possible will lead us to the solution! Some edge cases need to be considered such as if the start or the end of the input overlaps the map, not changing the input range if it doesn't fall into any of the maps, and checking any split off input ranges in case it falls into a different map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have converted the input ranges through each the maps and have our output ranges, we can simply check the smallest value in our ranges, this will be the smallest output that corresponds to one of our inputs!
    </p>

      <p>
        Both parts of today's puzzle can be solved with brute force since the inputs are not too large and finding the answer is computationally quite light. However there is a more efficient solution which runs in O(1) time.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve today's puzzle in O(1) time we can use quadratic inequalities. First lets express our problem as a mathematical statement:
      </p>
      $$ \large x(t - x) > d $$
      <p>
        Where <strong>x</strong> is how long to charge the boat, <strong>t</strong> is how much time we have, and <strong>d</strong> is the best distance that we have to beat. Here we subtract how much time we spend charging the boat with the time available, then with the remaining time we cover <strong>x</strong> distance every second.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lets quickly plot the outputs of the first example on the puzzle to visualise that we are dealing with a quadratic.
      </p>

      <img src="images/aoc-2023/day-6.png" style="width:100%">

      <p>
        We can see from the plot that by charging the boat for 0 seconds results in the boat going nowhere, same for spending the entire 7 seconds charging the boat. We can see however that the distance we cover is quadratic and there are two points where we cross the boundary for beating the current record (the red line). Any point above the red line beats the current record, so if we can find the critical points (in this case 2 and 5) then we can find the total number of configurations possible to beat the current record.

      <p>
        To find the critical points we first need to rearrange our equation into the form of a quadratic.
      </p>
      $$ \large xt - x^2 > d $$
      $$ \large xt - x^2 = d $$
      $$ \large xt - x^2 - d = 0 $$
      $$ \large -x^2 + xt - d = 0 $$
      <p>
        For 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in this form we can solve for x using the quadratic equation to find our two critical points.
      </p>

      $$ \large x = \frac{-t \pm \sqrt{t^2-4 \times -1 \times d}}{2\times-1} $$

      <p>
        Solving for the values <code>t=7</code> <code>d=9</code> gives us the following
      </p>
      <pre><code class="plaintext">
1.697 < x < 5.303

Since x can only be a whole number the possible valid values are:
[2, 3, 4, 5]
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        And so our answer for that input is 4!
      </p>
