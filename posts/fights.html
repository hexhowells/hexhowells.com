    <h1>The Real Fight is with Nature</h1>
    <p class="blog-date">Jan 08 2026</p>

    <p>
      You can choose to spend your live having one of two fights in the world, fights against people and fights against nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fights against people include all the challenges that we have made for ourselves, that did not exist prior to us. Status, politics, the stock market, wars, money. These fights are fictitious, they are a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJ9MFBPwXGwNpadf2/skill-the-map-is-not-the-territory">map</a>, they are arbitrary. We chose these battles, perhaps they serve a purpose, but we could have chosen different fights to have. They ultimately feel pointless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fights against nature is the ability to understand and control what was there before us, physics, biology, mathematics, engineering. These problems don't care that we exist, they don't change the rules, they don't exist for our entertainment, they existed before we were around and will continue to exist after we are gone. Don't you want to understand the nature of the universe? Do you really believe trying to predict the direction of the stock market to make more money is worth your limited time in this universe?
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that the majority of protests are pointless. They are a gathering of people who are unable to make change themselves, so instead they complain to others to make the changes instead. Protests only work if you can convince other people to solve your problems, this is not a fight against nature. Skip the people and go right to the source of the issue, build technology, bend the universe to your will to solve your problems, that is a much better use of your time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fights for status are equally pointless, you are simply trying to convince other's that you are important, that they should follow your wishes. Real power isn't convincing others to listen to you, true power is being able to travel across the planet in under a day, using nuclear reactions to produce energy, accessing the world's intelligence from your pocket, pushing a button and being warm. Power over nature is the real victory, what use would money be if we had no inventions to buy?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many jobs that are either fights against nature or people, of course there is always overlap, but there is certainly jobs in which your only fight is with people. Will your intricate understanding of the stock market, currently political environments, or socioeconomics be all that useful to humanity in 100 years time? 1000 years? The invention of the microprocessor, batteries, bridges certainly will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't play the game that other people invented, don't be passengers on <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Golgafrinchan_Ark_Fleet_Ship_B">Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B</a>, play the game that already exists. Understand the true beauty of the universe, take control over nature, that is the only game worth playing.
